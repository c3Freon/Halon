# Halon 3D-Printer
## What is Halon
Halon is my 3D-Printer design. Its an small self containt portable high speed FDM 3D-Printer.
I designed this priter to be my travel printer for events and as an rabbit prototyping printer. 

## Design Targets
1. The Printer should be usable as an praktical 3D-Printer
2. The Printer should be Self Containt. No external spool, no external power supply and an compleate printer enclosure.
3. The Printer should be as fast as possible. An design goal of 1m/s velocity and 100m/sÂ² has been set.
4. The Printer should be buildable with standard mashiens avavible in moast Hackspaces/Makerspaces.
