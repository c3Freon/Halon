# Halon 3D-Printer
## What is Halon
Halon is my 3D-Printer design. Its an small self containt portable high speed FDM 3D-Printer.
I designed this priter to be my travel printer for events and as an rabbit prototyping printer.

## Design Targets
1. The Printer should be usable as an praktical 3D-Printer
2. The Printer should be Self Containt. No external spool, no external power supply and an compleate printer enclosure.
3. The Printer should be as fast as possible. An design goal of 1m/s velocity and 100m/s² has been set.
4. The Printer should be buildable with standard mashiens avavible in moast Hackspaces/Makerspaces.

# Prototype 0
This Project started in autum 2023 as an studing project. I have developed the prototype over an halve jear and i build the prototype. On the GPN22 i presented the prototype. Because of the interest and feedback on the event, i decided to publish the design of printer so more people can build this design. 

The mechanics of the prototype function as Planned. It reaches an maximum speed of 0.5m/s with an acceleration of 100m/s² reliable without stepp loss. Even at this high acceleration the ringing on the axis is minimal. 
The print cooling system is sufficient even on maximum print speed. But, the prototype uses two 15mm turbines for the side cooling and an compressor for the head part cooling. Both are extremly loud (operator needs ear protection when opening the enclosure) which violates the first design target.
The extrusion system is currently the speed limiting factor on this mashien. The prototype uses an Creality K1 Hotend and an dual gear browden extruder. Its currently limited to 30mm³/s. The hotend and the XY motors get cooled by an water cooling loop.
